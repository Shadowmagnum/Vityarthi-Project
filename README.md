â˜• Java Fundamentals Showcase

âœ¨ Project Summary
This repository serves as a learning resource and a demonstration of fundamental to advanced Java concepts. Each .java file is an independent example focused on a specific topic, making it easy to navigate and understand. The topics covered include:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java Collections Framework

Exception Handling

Multithreading

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites
JDK 17 or a later compatible version is required to compile and run the code.

Running the Code
To run any of the example files, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the project directory.

Compile the desired .java file:

Bash

javac <FileName>.java
Run the compiled .class file:

Bash

java <FileName>
ðŸ“š Core Java Concepts Explained
JDK vs. JRE vs. JVM
JDK (Java Development Kit): This is the full development kit for Java. It includes the JRE, a compiler (javac), and other essential tools for writing and debugging Java applications. Think of it as the complete toolbox for a Java developer.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): This is the runtime environment needed to execute compiled Java programs. It contains the JVM and the Java class libraries. It's what an end-user needs to run a Java application.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): This is the virtual machine that executes Java bytecode. It's the core component of both the JRE and JDK, responsible for converting compiled Java code into machine-specific instructions.

The Evolution of Java
Java has undergone significant changes over the years. Here are some key milestones:

1995: Initial release by Sun Microsystems.

Java 2 (1998): Introduced the J2SE, J2EE, and J2ME platforms, standardizing Java for different environments.

Java 5 (2004): A major update that introduced Generics, Annotations, and the enhanced for loop, making code safer and more concise.

Java 8 (2014): Revolutionized Java with Lambda Expressions and the Streams API, which facilitated a more functional programming style.

Java 11 (2018): An LTS (Long-Term Support) version that refined syntax and performance.

Java 17 (2021): The latest LTS version at the time, which introduced sealed classes and enhanced switch expressions.
